# MTG AI

This project uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to make an AI agent that can answer complex Magic: The Gathing rules questions.

The RAG pipeline is hosted on Weaviate, using OpenAI and Anthropic models.

There are three collections being set up
1) The comprehensive rules of MTG
2) The rules text of all the cards
3) The official rulings of all the cards
